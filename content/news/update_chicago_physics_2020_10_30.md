**Has your institution acted on any of your demands? Are there any positive outcomes you have had?**

We’ve had an overall positive response. Our department chair has assigned a faculty committee or department administrator to each of our [action items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HCZrrs-nIS8VxoVlnub95Zi_rqEa1bQ6weHGjAc9kGw/view), along with contact people from our working group that they should be coordinating with. The departmental EDI committee is working on a strategic plan based around our call to action. Our group has been working on multiple action items by dividing into teams and our meetings with department faculty and administrators have gone well for the most part.
The department has done a few things on their own initiative:
* They removed the GRE/PGRE requirement for admissions this year. (We hope we can convince them to make this permanent.)
* The colloquium committee has started to actively recruit more URM colloquium speakers for this year.
* They have also made a new committee, the Faculty Excellence Committee, to identify candidates for a new faculty position, with the goal of inviting more URM candidates to apply. We think this is their way of working towards the “hire three Black tenure-track faculty” action item.
* They’ve also joined APS IDEA, and agreed to increase the number of students and postdocs on the EDI committee.

Besides this, our group has been able to make progress on several other initiatives:
* Graduate application fee waivers for students who have attended URM-focused events
* A physics course offered at “Discover UChicago” which brings high school students from underrepresented groups to campus for the summer to encourage them to apply to UChicago for college.
* Changing TA training to include anti-racism training (and hopefully with follow-through throughout the year)
* Standards for advisor-advisee relationships, with an expectations form you fill out together with your advisor. (Credit to the UChicago Astronomy IDEA group for making the form.)
* The Faculty Excellence Committee has provided a method for department members to recommend candidates for future positions, and agreed to allow graduate students to provide feedback on visiting candidates.
* We got approval and grant funding to run a pilot tutoring program that will teach math skills for introductory physics and provide peer tutoring jobs to undergraduate students.
* We are working with After School Matters, a program which brings middle-school Chicago Public Schools students to do research on campus, to have physics department labs participate
* We’re running a department-wide reading group in coordination with the EDI committee to moderate discussions on readings about racism in physics, academia, and society.
* We’ve made a website (not yet public) so we can share what we’re working on and hopefully get more people to join and help.


**Has your institution flatly refused any of your demands? Are there any other negative outcomes you have had?**

The faculty, with one exception, refused to sign our call to action which pledges a personal commitment to carrying out the action items. There was also one faculty member who sent a passive-aggressive, vaguely racist email to the whole department in response to the decision to remove the GRE/PGRE requirement for this year. However, for the most part there’s been a trend of people being very supportive of us in private (they’ve been overall pretty enthusiastic and generous with their time, actually), but getting people to make public statements and commitments has been difficult.

**Are there other actions you are taking which are not specifically directed at your institute’s administration (eg. student-facing or community-facing work)? Would you like to share anything from these efforts?**

See above answer to first big question.

**Are there any immediate priorities for the next 3 months?**

Our priorities for the next 3 months include the department-wide reading group first meeting, managing the tutoring program, confirming that the colloquium committee has successfully increased the number of speakers from underrepresented groups, checking that the changes to TA training are implemented, continuing to run our internal group book club, following the progress of the faculty search, running the undergraduate students survey, and possibly other projects (there’s a lot going on so I’m probably missing some things)

**Do you require any assistance or resources in particular from the other members of PAARC at this point? (Feel free to message us on the Slack channel anyway!)**

* UChicago is currently hiring for a physics faculty position. If you know anyone who might be interested in applying, please pass along the link! https://physics.uchicago.edu/about/job-opportunities/
* We’re thinking of writing a short blurb + talking points to encourage people to submit comments on the proposed DHS rule change that affects international students. The comment period is open until Oct 26, I believe. We could use some help getting the word out when we have a thing written, or if anyone is already working on this, maybe we can coordinate? (N/A now because deadline is past)
