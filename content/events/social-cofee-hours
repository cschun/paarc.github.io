[![Graduate Panel on Applying to Graduate School in Physics and Astronomy as a Person of Color on October 1st at 2-4pm PST, 3-5pm MT, 4-6pm CT, 5-7pm EST](https://paarc.info/BIPOC_Graduate_Panel_long_gif.gif)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/120489771149/)

**Current Physics/Astronomy graduate students of color will share their experiences applying to grad school while answering questions!**

About this Event
--------
Pursuing a PhD or Masters is one of the many options available with your physics or astronomy degree after college. Attending graduate school is a great way to continue learning about a subject on a deeper level and gain specific skills for future careers, in addition to being the next step on the road to an academic career. However students of color and first-generation college students may face unique challenges in applying to and succeeding in graduate school.

If you are a undergraduate student interested in applying to graduate school for Physics or Astronomy, or are wondering what that experience could look like for you, we invite you to attend our panel on Applying to Graduate School in Physics and Astronomy as a Person of Color on **October 1st at 2-4pm PST/ 3-5pm MT/ 4-6pm CT/ 5-7pm EST**. The panelists are current Physics/Astronomy graduate students of color that will share their experiences and answer questions about graduate school.

This event will be hosted by the Physics and Astronomy Anti-Racism Coalition (PAARC, a grassroots collective of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in physics and astronomy dedicated to engaging in anti-racism work across institutions and supporting physicists and astronomers of color.)

Panelists
--------

**Arianna Long**\
Arianna (she/her) is a black woman doctoral candidate studying massive galaxy evolution at UC Irvine. She is a first-gen student with a non-traditional academic background. She completed her undergraduate studies at Towson University in Applied Mathematics with a minor in education, worked in business consulting for a bit, returned to get her M.S. in physics at Cal State LA and then onward to UC Irvine to get that doctoral degree. In addition to her science, Arianna is passionate about building mentoring environments that support and develop scientific identities in people with marginalized backgrounds. Outside of academia, you can find her dancing in her living room, reading sci-fi/fantasy, gardening, or just generally laughing very loudly.

**Cesar Gonzalez Renteria**\
Cesar (he/him/his) is a fourth-year experimental particle physics graduate at UC Berkeley. He came to the U.S. from Mexico at 1 years old as the second youngest of 10 kids! Despite being number 9 of 10, he is the only one to have attended a four year university. He had a long route getting through grad school: straight into work after highschool, community college, work, transfer to undergrad, work, grad school. He currently works on probing the smallest scales inside the proton with the largest particle collider in the world. When he’s not working on detectors or code, he can be found dancing salsa and bachata and playing guitar/video games.

**George Iskander**\
George (he/him/his) is a first-year graduate student at the University of Chicago. He graduated from Yale with a major in Mathematics in Physics in May of 2020. He is first-generation and Egyptian-American. He’s really interested in the new and emergent field of precision physics. He’s passionate about peer support and mentorship, and helped found SU(5), a program for first-year graduate students. Apart from physics, he really enjoys DIY electronics, photography, and badminton!

**Landry Horimbere**\
Landry (he/him/his) is a fourth-year experimental plasma physics graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Originally from Burundi, he came to the United States when he was 7 years old. He had a complicated path to physics that went through getting kicked out of engineering and eventually graduating with two degrees in physics and interdisciplinary physical sciences. He currently conducts research on shear driven waves near dipolarization fronts at the Naval Research Laboratory and is also interested in fusion research. Additionally, Landry is committed to expanding outreach and mentorship programs for people from marginalized backgrounds and to highlighting the value of diversity in physics. Apart from physics, he enjoys playing soccer, board games and philosophical memes.

**Yasmeen Musthafa**\
Yasmeen (they/them/theirs) is a South/East Asian second-year graduate student at UC Irvine. They currently study plasma physics: specifically, electron generation from relativistic laser-solid interactions. Outside of physics, they’re passionate about curriculum design, physics outreach, and facilitating inclusive mentorship. In their free time, they enjoy making up particularly absurd Fermi problems to test-drive on their students (probing the Lorentz contraction of Lightning McQueen and other such mysteries of the universe) and cultivating their extensive knowledge of Witcher 3 lore.
