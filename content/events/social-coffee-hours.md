Are you an undergrad looking to chat with grad students about research, grad school, and the BIPOC experience in the Physics and Astronomy community? Are you a grad student, postdoc or faculty member looking to get more involved in addressing the racial and gender equity gap? Come join our weekly coffee hour! It's an informal online space for people from all levels of the Physics and Astronomy community. Often, these coffee hours will be themed, and will feature PAARC members or associates with specific skills on various topics pertaining to grad school, research, and social justice work in academia.
